<error>Unattended installer requires a compilation policy.</error>

Some packages may require executing compilation steps, such as converting
SCSS to CSS.

By default, <comment>composer asks for permission before executing downloaded
compilation steps. However, it is not possible to ask during unattended
installation.

You must set a preference via environment-variable or composer
configuration, e.g.

 - <comment>export COMPOSER_COMPILE=on</comment>
 - <comment>export COMPOSER_COMPILE=off</comment>
 - <comment>composer config extra.compile-mode on</comment>
 - <comment>composer config extra.compile-mode off</comment>

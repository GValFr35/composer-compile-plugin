Some packages may require executing compilation steps, such as converting
SCSS to CSS.

<info>If you trust the provider of your packages</info>, then you can proceed with
compilation.

<info>If you prefer to review the codebase more carefully</info> before executing
anything, then skip compilation. (To manually compile later, run the
"<comment>composer compile</comment>" command.)

<info>To avoid asking this question in the future</info>, you may set a preference via
environment variable or composer configuration, e.g.

 - <comment>export COMPOSER_COMPILE=on</comment>
 - <comment>export COMPOSER_COMPILE=off</comment>
 - <comment>composer config extra.compile-mode on</comment>
 - <comment>composer config extra.compile-mode off</comment>
